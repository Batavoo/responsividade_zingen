This project is a **responsive landing page** built as a personal challenge to recreate a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1371886246180677672) using only HTML and CSS. The main goal was to practice web layout skills, CSS organization, and responsive techniques—transforming a Figma prototype into a functional, adaptable web page.

## 🎯 About the Challenge

- **Objective:** Recreate a provided Figma landing page as closely as possible.
- **Focus:** Responsive design, semantic HTML, and clean CSS structure.
- **Learning:** Improved my understanding of layout systems (Flexbox, Grid), media queries, and component-based CSS.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Fully responsive:** Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **CSS organization:** Modular styles for easy maintenance.
- **No frameworks:** Pure HTML and CSS, no JavaScript or build tools.
